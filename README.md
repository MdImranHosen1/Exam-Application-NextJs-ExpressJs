# Exam Application

## Description

This application is designed to help you prepare for viva exams effectively. It allows you to set a large number of questions, organized by topic. Each day, you can simulate a viva by facing questions selected from the topics you've chosen. 

One unique feature of the app is the audio option, which records your responses during the test. After completing the viva simulation, you can listen to these recordings to assess your performance and identify areas for improvement.

This tool is perfect for systematic and thorough viva preparation, enabling you to review and refine your answers in a structured way.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MdImranHosen1/Exam-Application-NextJs-ExpressJs
   cd Exam-Application-NextJs-ExpressJs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - For the backend (Express.js):

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

   - For the frontend (React.js):

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend**

   - Navigate to the backend directory:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Start the backend:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The backend will start and listen on `http://localhost:5000` (or any port specified in your configuration).

2. **Start the frontend**

   - Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Start the frontend:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The frontend will start and open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

If your application includes tests, you can run them with:

- For the backend:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm test
  ```

- For the frontend:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```

## Deployment

For deploying the application, you might need to follow specific instructions based on your hosting provider. Typically, you will build the frontend and configure your backend to serve static files from the `frontend/build` directory.

- **Build the frontend**:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run build
  ```

- **Serve the built files**:

  Ensure your Express backend is configured to serve static files from `frontend/build`.
